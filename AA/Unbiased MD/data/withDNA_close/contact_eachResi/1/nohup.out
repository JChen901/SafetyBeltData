GROMACS reminds you: "A cop pulls Heisenberg over and asks him 'Do you know how fast you were going?' Heisenberg replies 'No, but I know exactly where I am'. The cop says 'You were doing 55 in a 35 zone'. Heisenberg: 'Great! Now I'm lost!" (Anonymous)

GROMACS reminds you: "I was told I'd never make it to VP rank because I was too outspoken. Maybe so, but I think men will always find an excuse for keeping women in their 'place.' So, let's make that place the executive suite and start more of our own companies." (Jean Bartik, ENIAC developer)

GROMACS reminds you: "Scientists do not join hands every Sunday and sing "Yes gravity is real! I know gravity is real! I will have faith! I believe in my heart that what goes up, up, up must come down, down, down. Amen!" If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure about the concept." (Dan Barker)

GROMACS reminds you: "Scientists do not join hands every Sunday and sing "Yes gravity is real! I know gravity is real! I will have faith! I believe in my heart that what goes up, up, up must come down, down, down. Amen!" If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure about the concept." (Dan Barker)

GROMACS reminds you: "It is an unfortunate fact that when you raise the question of the reliability of many simulations you are often told about how much manpower went into it, how large & fast the computer is, how important the problem is, and such things, which are completely irrelevant to the question that was asked." (Richard Hamming)

GROMACS reminds you: "I'm a strong believer that ignorance is important in science. If you know too much, you start seeing reasons why things won't work. That's why its important to change your field to collect more ignorance." (Sydney Brenner)
